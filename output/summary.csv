0,steak,"['merlot', 'cabernet sauvignon', 'pinot noir']","Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Steak. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Sterling Vineyards Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 29 dollars per bottle."
1,Hamburger,"['malbec', 'merlot', 'zinfandel']","Malbec, Merlot, and Zinfandel are great choices for Burger. Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. One wine you could try is Bodegas Renacer Punto Final Malbec Reserva. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars."
