0,steak,"['merlot', 'cabernet sauvignon', 'pinot noir']","Steak works really well with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Beringer Howell Mountain Bancroft Ranch Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle."
1,Hamburger,"['malbec', 'merlot', 'zinfandel']","Burger works really well with Malbec, Merlot, and Zinfandel. Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Alamos Malbec Mendoza Seleccion with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle."
